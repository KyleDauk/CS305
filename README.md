**# CS 305 – Secure Software Development Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains selected coursework artifacts from **CS 305: Software Security**. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to analyze software security risks, apply secure coding practices, and document vulnerability assessments in a professional manner suitable for real-world software development environments.

The artifact included in this repository reflects my understanding of secure software development principles and the importance of integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Client Summary
The client for this course was **Artemis Financial**, a financial services company responsible for developing software that processes sensitive customer data. Artemis Financial required a security-focused evaluation of its existing application to identify vulnerabilities and improve overall system security. The primary objective was to reduce risk by addressing weaknesses related to encryption, dependency management, and secure communication while maintaining application functionality.

## Secure Coding and Vulnerability Assessment
When assessing the client’s software, I effectively identified potential security vulnerabilities by applying structured vulnerability assessment techniques and secure coding principles. Emphasizing secure coding is critical because it protects sensitive information, reduces exposure to cyberattacks, and improves system reliability. Strong software security contributes directly to a company’s long-term stability, customer trust, and regulatory compliance.

## Challenges and Key Takeaways
One of the more challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was determining which vulnerabilities posed the greatest risk and should be addressed first. This process reinforced the importance of evaluating both likelihood and impact when making security decisions. Understanding how to prioritize vulnerabilities is essential for managing security effectively in real-world development environments.

## Defense-in-Depth and Future Security Practices
Security layers were increased by implementing best practices such as proper encryption, secure configuration settings, and careful dependency management. In future projects, I would continue using automated vulnerability-scanning tools and established security frameworks to assess risks and determine appropriate mitigation strategies.

---

## Verification of Functionality and Security
After refactoring the application to address identified vulnerabilities, I verified that the software remained functional and secure by running tests and reviewing application behavior. Dependency reports and validation checks were used to ensure that new vulnerabilities were not introduced during the refactoring process.

---

## Tools, Resources, and Practices
This project utilized secure coding standards, vulnerability assessment techniques, and static analysis tools to identify and mitigate risks. These resources and practices will continue to be valuable in future coursework and professional software development tasks where security is a priority.

---

## Portfolio Value
This repository demonstrates my ability to perform vulnerability assessments, apply secure software development practices, and document security findings clearly and professionally. These skills are directly applicable to industry roles that require secure application development and risk-aware decision making.
